README
This program is designed to run as album/jukebox system. The user is able to select individual albums using the left and right arrow keys, and the middle button plays a short 15 sec 
sample of one of the songs off of the selected album.

The program creates the original album upon pushing an arrow and each subsiquent arrow press removes the previous album and creates a new one in its place,
The id of the album is unique which allows the "playAlbum" function to check the id of each primitive and play the appropriate song. The user is able to go forward or backward in selection
without any issue. If the user plays a song before the previous one finishes, the previous song pauses and will resume in the same place when the user selects the song again.
